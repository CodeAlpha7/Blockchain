## Blockchain Data Storage and Verification

1. Setup an Ethereum Blockchain using Truffle and Ganache - design, test and deploy

2. Write smart contracts using Solidity for the Ethereum Blockchain

3. Store actual data on cloud storage like Amazon S3 and their links on the blockchain

4. Design a user interface

5. Setup 2 API endpoints (upload, download) using ExpressJS

6. Setup 2 backend servers (user-interface & blockchain, blockchain & cloud storage)

7. Performance evaluation possibly by endpoint stress testing using Postman or using Apache Jmeter, chai, Mocha (Javascript testrunners)
