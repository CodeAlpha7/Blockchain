Welcome to the Buzzcoin Carnival! School sanctioned gambling since it is not real
money. Like most people in crypto, the owners of this carnival have terrible
business sense. There are a million ways to cheat, and multiple bugs. Somehow,
on every game, the house always loses?? Who thought this was a good idea. The
entrance fee for most games is 1 buzz.

There are a few games:

1) Guess the Number
2) A Duel, with a high roller version (entrance fee 5 buzz)
3) Pay to Mine
4) King of the Hill
5) Mayor Voting

To receive a 100 on this assignment you must:

1) Call at least 50 transactions
2) Play each game at least once, except King of the Hill, which you do not have
to play at all. (KOTH is a money maker though, huge payoffs)
3) Turn in a writeup. Describe how to play each game, any bugs you found and
exploited, any code you wrote. Describe the optimal strategy for each game.
4) Screenshot of your final balance in metamask
5) List of all your txids (can print this through web3).

For this assignment, there is no such thing as cheating. The only thing which
is off limits is to denial-of-service me, the node, or other players. If you
know anything about game theory, the optimal strategy may not be to compete
with your peers, but to conspire.

At the end of the assignment, the three highest holding buzzcoin wallets will
receive grade bonuses. First place will receive a full letter grade, 10 bonus
points. Second and Third each get 5,3 points to the final grade respectively. More
random buzzcoin rewards may be dropped occasionally.
